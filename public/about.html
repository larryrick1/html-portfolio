<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello. My name is Lawrence R. Williams. When I started primary school, my teacher called me Larry, and since 
   then, so has everyone else. Outside of work/school, I'm called by my nickname, "Rick," which stems from my 
   middle name, Richard. I go by "larryrick1" on the internet.

  I enjoy my job as a registered nurse in an inner-city health system. I am on a journey to combine nursing 
  with software engineering, and I enjoy every minute of it.
